            We work with builders and contractors who specialise in eco-friendly building practices. We also conduct
            assessments of a property's energy and water usage, as well as its overall sustainability features, to
            ensure that it aligns with our eco-friendly standards.

            Not necessarily. While some eco-friendly features may require an initial investment, such as solar panels or
            energy-efficient systems, they can ultimately lead to long-term cost savings on utility bills. Additionally,
            there are often government incentives and tax breaks available for eco-friendly properties and features.
